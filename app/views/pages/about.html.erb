    <h3>What is this?</h3>
    <p>
      This website looks through your Last.FM scrobble history to determine your most listened to albums that came out in 2012.
      We then make a pretty looking page so you can see this list, and hopefully share it with your friends.
    </p>
    <p>
			To find out what year an album was released, it checks Last.FM, and as a fallback, MusicBrainz.
      Any inaccuracies are (probably) their fault.

    <h3>Who made it?</h3>
    <p>
      A dude named Clif Reeder. Hit him up on <%= link_to "Twitter", "http://twitter.com/clifreeder", :target => "_blank" %>,
      and maybe <%= link_to "check out his blog", "http://blog.clifreeder.com", :target => "_blank" %>.
      And of course, the source for this project is on <%= link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/clifff/albums_of_the_year" , :target => "_blank" %>.
